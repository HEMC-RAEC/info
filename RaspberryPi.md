# Raspberry Pi
## What is a Raspberry Pi?
According to the Raspberry Pi Foundation:

    "The Raspberry Pi is a low cost, credit-card sized computer that plugs into a computer monitor or TV, and uses a standard keyboard and mouse. It is a capable little device that enables people of all ages to explore computing, and to learn how to program in languages like Scratch and Python. It’s capable of doing everything you’d expect a desktop computer to do, from browsing the internet and playing high-definition video, to making spreadsheets, word-processing, and playing games.

    What’s more, the Raspberry Pi  has the ability to interact with the outside world, and has been used in a wide array of digital maker projects, from music machines and parent detectors to weather stations and tweeting birdhouses with infra-red cameras. We want to see the Raspberry Pi being used by kids all over the world to learn to program and understand how computers work."

## Raspberry Pi Hardware
The Raspberry Pi Foundation has released *many* distinct hardware platforms that can be used.  A detailed description of all the platforms can be found on the [Raspberry Pi Hardware Page](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/).

Members of the club have used most, if not all, of the Raspberry Pi hardware platforms. The RAEC will focus on the following:
- [Raspberry Pi 4 Model B](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/)
- [Raspberry Pi Zero W](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-2-w/)
- [Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/)

While the other platforms will work just as well for many of the planned activities and projects, documentation and details will be initially geared toward these three.

### Raspberry Pi 4 Model B
The Raspberry Pi Foundation has provided a comprehensive "Beginner's Guide", located [here](https://magpi.raspberrypi.com/books/beginners-guide-4th-ed).  The free download is available for all users as a digital copy of the material.

There is also several other guides/information provided by The Raspberry Pi Foundation.  See below for several links to these:
- [Official Documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/)
- [Raspberry Pi Projects](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/)

### Raspberry Pi Zero W
The Raspberry Pi Zero W is very similar to the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B in several regards.  It has fewer, slower CPU cores, less memory, reduced power usage, and a smaller footprint.  The Zero W device is intended to be closer to an embedded computing environment while still maintaining a full user operating system (OS). This results in a trade-off in power and capability, but is often better for some projects.

### Raspberry Pi Pico
The Raspberry Pi Pico is a fully embedded computing platform, which means it differs from the other hardware platforms significantly.  There is no full user OS on the Pico and specific tools must be used to load and run software.  

The Raspberry Pi Foundation has provided documentation on how to get started with the Pico [here](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/)
