# Welcome to the HEMC Robotics and Electronics Club!
The [HEMC](https://hemc.org) Robotics and Electronics Club has been organized for individuals interested in electronics, embedded systems, home automation, robotics and other related topics that bridges the digital world into the physical.  Regular club meetings help promote learning about how to use software to act on the physical world.

Some of the activities that you can participate as part of the the club are:
- Create a home automation system
- Learn to develop on embedded systems, like the Raspberry Pi Pico, Arduino, or ESP32.
- Capture input from sensors, touchpads, and cameras
- Learn about and build locomotive robots

The club invites individuals of all skill levels to join us in this exciting hobby!
