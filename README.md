# Welcome to the HEMC Robotics and Electronics Club!
The [HEMC](https://hemc.org) Robotics and Electronics Club has been organized for individuals interested in electronics, embedded systems, home automation, robotics and other related topics that bridges the digital world into the physical.  Regular club meetings help promote learning about how to use software to act on the physical world.

Some of the activities that you can participate as part of the the club are:
- Create a home automation system
- Learn to develop on embedded systems, like the Raspberry Pi Pico, Arduino, or ESP32.
- Capture input from sensors, touchpads, and cameras
- Learn about and build locomotive robots

The club invites individuals of all skill levels to join us in this exciting hobby!

## Groups.io
The club will be using the Groups.io service to communicate with the club and for members to interact with each other.  The service allows club members to send email to a single address and it will be distributed to all club members.

The email address for this service is: [hemc-raec@groups.io](hemc-raec@groups.io).  To send a new message, simply send a normal email to this address.  You can also reply to messages with any email program, like you do with any email, by clicking the reply button.  Please add this email address to your safe sender list or to your email clientâ€™s contacts so that you don't miss any email messages.

You can also view your messages and manage you preferences on the web.  To view messages on the web, you can visit the HEMC Robotics & Electronics Club Groups.io service here: https://groups.io/g/hemc-raec.  

Some additional, important links are below:
- Set your subscription settings here: https://groups.io/g/hemc-raec/editsub.
- Unsubscribe by sending an email to: hemc-raec+unsubscribe@groups.io

If you have any issues using Groups.io, please contact the Robotics & Electronics Club at hemc.raec@gmail.com (or post on the Groups.io hemc-raec@groups.io service itself). 

## Hardware Information
As part of the many activities planned for the club, we will be using several hardware platforms in our projects.  Because the interaction with them is similar to any other computer, our beginning / basic activities and projects will be built primarily using the [Raspberry Pi](RaspberryPi.md) platform.  Raspberry Pi has several platforms, including the Raspberry Pi 4 B, the Raspberry Pi Zero (W), and the Raspberry Pi Pico.  Each of these platforms are described, and resource links are available, on the [Raspberry Pi](RaspberryPi.md) page.

As we move beyond the most basic projects, embedded computing platforms will be used.  These platforms include the Raspberry Pi Pico, but also the [Arduino](Arduino.md) and the [ESP32](ESP32.md) platforms.  Information will be provided, and resource links available, on each of these pages for these platforms.

## Schedule
### 2023
**February** - The Club kick-off event will be held at the Digital Garage on the Houston Campus.  It is expected that later activities will be accessible to family members/annuitants as well as employees, however, this kick off session will be held on-campus.  If you would like to invite family members, please follow campus procedures for obtaining a visitor badge for those attending.

**March** - A virtual session will be held in order to provide an overview of the platforms being used and answer any questions about the upcoming activities. 

**April** - This activity will focus on hands-on experience with the Raspberry Pi platform.  Members will learn to load an operating system (OS) on the device and how to log into it remotely. Members will have the opportunity to run / adjust a program on the Raspberry Pi to blink a light, a key foundation in interacting with physical world from code.  Information will be provided about Home Automation distributions that will be used during the next meeting.

**Summer** - Tour of the ExxonMobil robot facility in Friendswood, TX.  More information to be provided at a future date.
